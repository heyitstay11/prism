                <p>
                    Literature broadly is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings 
                    specifically considered to be an art form, especially prose fiction, drama, and poetry. In recent 
                    centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature, much of which has been transcribed.
                    Literature is a method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment.

                        Perseverance, nicknamed Percy, is a car-sized Mars rover designed to
                         explore Jezero Crater on Mars as part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission. 
                         It was manufactured by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and launched 
                         on 30 July 2020 at 11:50:00 UTC. Confirmation that the rover 
                         successfully landed on Mars was received on 18 February 2021 
                         at 20:55 UTC. As of 26 February 2021, Perseverance has been
                          on Mars for 7 sols (8 Earth days).

                    <p class="articlesummary">
                        When the world stopped this year, many people found themselves looking out
                         the window, hearing birdsong replace car horns and watching green buds
                          emerge from the frozen ground. In a moment of darkness, it was a wonderful 
                          balm to turn to nature. And in her beautiful collection of essays, Vesper
                           Flights, Helen Macdonald shows us how to better observe and comprehend 
                           the scenes around us.
